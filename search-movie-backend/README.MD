Node.js Server app

## Available Scripts

In the project directory (/search-movie-backend), install the project:

### `npm install`

Then run the command:

### `npm start`

You should see it running in your command line terminal with a message saying:
"node src/server.js"
"Server is running"

Or open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to view it in your browser.

Note: The backend makes a REST API call to OMDB, which you will need an API Key for. Please ensure you have a local .env file inside the root folder, with the key/value pair OMDB_API_KEY="YOUR_OWN_KEY".
